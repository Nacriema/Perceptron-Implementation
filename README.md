# Perceptron-Implementation
Build a simple perceptron for binary classification task

## Data
I use Iris data for demonstrate it.

## Conclusion
* Linear classifier, no non-linear boundaries possible
* Binary classifier, cannot solve XOR problem, for example. Why, cus ..... ^^
* Does not converge if classes are not linearly separable
* Many "optional" solutions in term of 0/1 loss on the training data, most will not be optimal in term of generalization performance
